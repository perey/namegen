Sources for Data on Common Names
================================

It is the position of the author of this software that lists of common names in
various languages and nationalities are collections of fact, ineligible for
copyright protection, and hence the data files included with this software are
considered to be public domain. Nonetheless, it is appropriate to acknowledge
the following sources of this information, out of both gratitude and academic
rigour.

Chinese
=======
Chinese surnames are so heavily weighted towards a few common names that "the
hundred surnames" is an idiomatic term for the Chinese people. Most data on
these names was taken from Wikipedia (primarily the articles "`Chinese surname
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_surname>`_" and "`List of common Chinese
surnames <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames>`_"),
which collects data from a number of primary sources.

In contrast, Chinese given names are theoretically endless in variety, as they
can be composed of any of the thousands of Chinese characters in use. Moreover,
the practice of giving a child another person's name is actively avoided, and
so there is really no such thing as a "common" name. However, some characters
*are* more common than others, and some combinations of them crop up with
greater frequency.

`Research by Chih-Hao Tsai <http://technology.chtsai.org/namefreq/>`_ was
invaluable in identifying these "not common but more frequent" names. Genders
were assigned to these names using the `NamSor Gendre API
<http://namesorts.com/2014/03/27/chinese-name-gender-guesser-api/>`_. Pinyin
readings were obtained from the `Unicode Han Database
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr38/>`_.

Danish
======
Danmarks Statistik (Statistics Denmark) maintains the Central Population
Register (CPR), and some very useful extracts and search systems in both
`Danish <http://dst.dk/da/Statistik/emner/navne.aspx>`_ and `English
<http://dst.dk/en/Statistik/emner/navne.aspx>`_.

"Top 20" lists for surnames and male and female given names are provided, but
the ability to find how many Danes have a particular name was especially
helpful in fleshing out the lists beyond these top few.

Finnish
=======
The Väestötietojärjestelmä (VTJ; "Population Information System") provides
`data sets <https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en/dataset/none>`_ listing all names
that occur more than 50 times in the VTJ: surnames, first names (for men and
women), and personal names after the first (for men and women).
